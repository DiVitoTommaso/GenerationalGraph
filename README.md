# GenerationalGraph
A smart pointer for Rust to create and manipulate generational graphs in single-thread and multi-thread context without runtime overhead. This smart pointer has been created taking the smart pointer GhostCell as example of the idea.

# Inconsistencies
The last chapter presented in the thesis (GenerationalGraph) slightly differ from the actual implementation of the smart pointer, because it has been refined over the time.
